   From the **Module Manager** you can see all the available plugins classified by categories. On the right side of each of them you have the options to manage them as you wish.

## Setting

We continue with the configuration of the module in question.

1. At first glance you will see a list with all the products on the page. Select one or more products that you want to display in the recommended list.

   Once selected, click the _Save_ button and you will see how they are added to the list.

2. A basic list of recommended products will be displayed below. The information displayed is the _Product ID_, _Product name_ and _Price with tax_, plus a simple button to _Remove the product_ from the list.

   If the product is removed, it will no longer appear on the list in case we stop recommending it.

## How is it used?

1. First, once in the configuration section of the module, you will see a search bar next to a selectable list with all the products.

2. We can select the products we want directly from the list and hit the save button. Or, you can write the name of the product directly in the search bar so that when you click the Save button or the enter key, the list of products will be updated with the products related to the search term.

3. Finally, the selected products will be displayed in a list where you can see the name, price and ID of the product, along with a Delete button in case you want to delete the product from the list.

## View in the Front-Office

Now if you go to the main page of the store, you can see the list of recommended products. A simple view where you can see the _image of the product_, _name_, _price_, button to _add to cart_ and another button to _add the product to the favorites list_.

# Conclusion

This module has been created for a technical test for the company Netenders. Made in 3 days in the best possible way.

> It should be noted that this module could be much better optimized by adding a product search bar so that a list of all products does not appear. As well as separating some module functions in a **controllers** folder, adding _CSS_ styles or effects with _JS_ saved to their respective folders, and much more.
