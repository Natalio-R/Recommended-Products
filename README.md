## Facility

Follow these steps to proceed with the installation of a module in PrestaShop.

1. It is necessary to download the `.zip` file where it will contain the necessary files for its use. You can download it through this link.

From the **Module Manager** you can see all the available plugins classified by categories. On the right side of each of them you have the options to manage them as you wish.

## Setting
We continue with the configuration of the module in question.

1. At first glance you will see a list with all the products on the page. Select one or more products that you want to display in the recommended list.

Once selected, click the *Save* button and you will see how they are added to the list.

2. A basic list of recommended products will be displayed below. The information displayed is the *Product ID*, *Product name* and *Price with tax*, plus a simple button to *Remove the product* from the list.

If the product is removed, it will no longer appear on the list in case we stop recommending it.

## View in the Front-Office
Now if you go to the main page of the store, you can see the list of recommended products. A simple view where you can see the *image of the product*, *name*, *price*, button to *add to cart* and another button to *add the product to the favorites list*.

# Conclusion
This module has been created for a technical test for the company Netenders. Made in 3 days in the best possible way.

> It should be noted that this module could be much better optimized by adding a product search bar so that a list of all products does not appear. As well as separating some module functions in a **controllers** folder, adding *CSS* styles or effects with *JS* saved to their respective folders, and much more.
